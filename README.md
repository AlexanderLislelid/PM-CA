Take note of the following

    There should be a minimum of 15 discrete tasks in your plan. If you have fewer than this your task definitions may be too broad and should be made more specific. For example, “Create High Definition Figma Designs”, “ Create GitHub repository”, "Test Website" could be broken down into "WCAG Testing", "HTML Validation", "Cross Browser Testing", etc.
    You may add as many additional fields to your Task items as you require. The instructions above state the minimum fields required. Other useful fields may include "Work Type", such as "Design", "Testing", "HTML" or "CSS", etc. Take some time to play around with Project settings and custom fields.
    You may adjust your plan in future when you receive the exam brief, including target dates. This project plan is a guide, not a contract. Without the exam brief, there is a limit to how detailed you can make your plan.
    Test that it is possible to view your Project as a Kanban or Roadmap/Gantt view in an incognito window or while logged out of GitHub. If you cannot access this in incognito, your teacher won't be able to either.

Process

    Create a new public GitHub Projects board with the name `PM Project`.

    Use the Kanban template to create a Kanban view with the appropriate status columns. See template below:
    Kanban template in GitHub

    Within your Project page create a new Roadmap view tab.

    Within your Roadmap view, create two new Date fields called Start Date and Target Date.

    Create a task/issue for each step in your project plan with the following details:

        Title (A short description of the task)
        Description (A detailed description of the task)
        Size (How much effort the task will require)
        Start Date (When the task should be started)
        Target/End Date (When the task should be completed)
